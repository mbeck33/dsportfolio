## Description

In my tenure as a student of the Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies, I've had the fortunate opportunity to develop both the theoretical background and the practical application of techniques in the Data Science discipline. Through my coursework in Database Administration, Data Analytics, Scripting for Data Analysis, Big Data Analytics, Quantitative Reasoning in Data Science and Marketing Analytics, I've demonstrated this development through reports and presentations built using a combination of tools like Python, R, and Tableau. The following documents represent my aptitude and demonstrated excellence in the core competencies for this program:

* Understanding and articulation of the major practice areas of data science
* Collection and organization of Data
* Identification of patterns in data via visualization, statistical analysis, and data mining
* Development of alternative strategies based on data
* Development of actions plans to implement business decisions derived from analyses
* Demonstration of communication skills for a wider business audience
* Ability to synthesize the ethical dimensions of the data science practice
